                    This is a timed quiz meant to test how much you remember 
                of the Javascript you have learned thus far.  Reviewing our
                knowledge helps to keep it fresh in our minds and saves 
                valuable time away from MDN and Stack Overflow!

                    The quiz will begin as soon as you click the button below.
                Click the button for the correct answer as quick as you can 
                because the time remaining when you complete the quiz is your
                High Score.
                
                    Be careful!  Each question you answer incorrectly will
                subtract precious seconds off your potential score!

                    Good Luck!
